    <p>We’ll be joined by Ojus Doshi and Michael McDermott who will both speak about projects they are currently working on.</p>

    <p>Ojus will share progress on a rough idea for a tool for organizing and cataloguing typefaces by emotion. Michael will have a chat about the beginnings of a project that will recover and exhibit data — images, video, audio, and text — from used cell phones.</p>

    <h4 id="ojus-doshi">Ojus Doshi</h4>
    <p>Ojus Doshi is a graphic designer living in Brooklyn, NY. He received his MFA in Graphic Design from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2015. He has taught and guest lectured at RISD, The New School, Pratt, Brown University and University of the Arts.</p>

    <p>His first forays into art and design began as a 4th grader when he established the totally legitimate design firm, Ojus Drawing Co. The firm won several industry awards from his mom, and specialized in greeting cards and comic book character drawings. After a brief 15-year hiatus that involved a biology degree from Brown, an honors thesis in X-Ray Crystallography, and various research roles at a world-renowned biotech company, he returned to the firm in 2011.</p>

    <p>He is interested in designing experiences and tools that weave digital, print, and spatial media. In addition to visual communication, he enjoys research and critical writing, as well as the art of presenting in front of all types of audiences.</p>

    <p>Outside of design, he’s always had a love for hip-hop, bhangra, garba, and Bollywood dance styles, and tries to take dance classes whenever he can both online and around NYC.</p>
