      <p>What is Sunday Salon? In case youâ€™re unfamiliar, Sunday Salon is a monthly(-ish) gathering of designer-educator-researchers that takes place on the internet. It is a project of Adjunct and started in 2019.</p>
      <p>The about page needs some more content? Could be a good place for some chair graphics to show up? I think a more horizontal image would work best.</p>
