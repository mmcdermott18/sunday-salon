    <p>Itâ€™s almost been one year since we held our first Sunday Salon, and what a year it has been. We are so grateful for this community, and for the nourishment and support that you all have so generously offered during this heartbreaking, strange year.
As the semester, and the year 2020, comes to a close, weâ€™d love to gather with you to collectively celebrate the Sunday Salon community. Weâ€™re so grateful for your thoughtful presentations, questions, and creative contributions, and we want to throw a little party to express our gratitude.
This semesterâ€™s been a doozy, weâ€™re tired of Zoom, and yet we know that it remains the safest way for us to come together.
Want to get dressed up and drink, like me? Great! Don your most festive attire, and slosh together whateverâ€™s left of your best bottles.
Not feeling festive, but still feeling social? Week-old sweatpants areâ€”as everâ€”welcome. Raise a toast with us with whatever glass of stale water or cold coffee is nearest you.
Canâ€™t, just canâ€™t? Donâ€™t! No pressure.
Save the date for Sunday, December 20th, for an afternoon/evening of connection, commiseration, and visioning how we might best support you and your brilliant work in the year to come. Thereâ€™ll be themed cocktails! Prizes! And more!</p>
