    <p>It’s almost been one year since we held our first Sunday Salon, and what a year it has been. We are so grateful for this community, and for the nourishment and support that you all have so generously offered during this heartbreaking, strange year.</p>

    <p>As the semester, and the year 2020, comes to a close, we’d love to gather with you to collectively celebrate the Sunday Salon community. We’re so grateful for your thoughtful presentations, questions, and creative contributions, and we want to throw a little party to express our gratitude.</p>

    <p>This semester’s been a doozy, we’re tired of Zoom, and yet we know that it remains the safest way for us to come together.</p>

    <p>Want to get dressed up and drink, like me? Great! Don your most festive attire, and slosh together whatever’s left of your best bottles.</p>

    <p>Not feeling festive, but still feeling social? Week-old sweatpants are—as ever—welcome. Raise a toast with us with whatever glass of stale water or cold coffee is nearest you.</p>

    <p>Can’t, just can’t? Don’t! No pressure.</p>

    <p>Save the date for Sunday, December 20th, for an afternoon/evening of connection, commiseration, and visioning how we might best support you and your brilliant work in the year to come. There’ll be themed cocktails! Prizes! And more!</p>
