    <p>Itâ€™s almost been one year since we held our first Sunday Salon, and what a year it has been. We are so grateful for this community, and for the nourishment and support that you all have so generously offered during this heartbreaking, strange year.</p>

    <p>As the semester, and the year 2020, comes to a close, weâ€™d love to gather with you to collectively celebrate the Sunday Salon community. Weâ€™re so grateful for your thoughtful presentations, questions, and creative contributions, and we want to throw a little party to express our gratitude.</p>

    <p>This semesterâ€™s been a doozy, weâ€™re tired of Zoom, and yet we know that it remains the safest way for us to come together.</p>

    <p>Want to get dressed up and drink, like us? Great! Don your most festive attire, and slosh together whateverâ€™s left of your best bottles.</p>

    <p>Not feeling festive, but still feeling social? Week-old sweatpants areâ€”as everâ€”welcome. Raise a toast with us with whatever glass of stale water or cold coffee is nearest you.</p>

    <p>Canâ€™t, just canâ€™t? Donâ€™t! No pressure.</p>

    <p>Save the date for Sunday, December 20th, for an afternoon/evening of connection, commiseration, and visioning how we might best support you and your brilliant work in the year to come. Thereâ€™ll be themed cocktails! Prizes! And more!</p>
