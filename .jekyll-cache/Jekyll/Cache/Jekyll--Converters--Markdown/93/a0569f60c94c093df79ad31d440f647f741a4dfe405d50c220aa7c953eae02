    <p>We are planning an active and participatory discussion around Bias and Grading, and we hope youâ€™ll be able to take part.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™ll be centering our discussion around the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What role does grading play in your teaching practice?</li>
      <li>What strategies do you use to reduce bias in grading?</li>
      <li>How might bias play a role in the ways we evaluate participation?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The structure of the Salon will be a combination of informal panel discussions, and small group reflections.</p>

    <h4 id="what-role-does-grading-play-in-your-teaching-practice">What role does grading play in your teaching practice?</h4>
    <p>The panel discussed questions like: Are you an â€˜easy graderâ€™ or â€˜hard graderâ€™ and does it matter? Should grades be used to motivate students? Or are grades for comparing students to the class as a whole? What role, beyond completing assignments, might students play in assessment? The members of this panel were <a href="https://benjaminshaykin.com/">Ben Shaykin</a>, <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=V1c2NjJOZnlNdjBTd3dZRXNIa0t1UT09">Chris Lee</a>, and <a href="https://portal.cca.edu/people/allorente/">Ana Llorente</a>.</p>

    <p>The panel discussed questions like: Do you work with a rubric? Do students self-assess? Effective grading systems for reducing teacher bias? Are there outside faculty / external critics that review student work?

    <p>The panel discussed questions like: During remote learning, how to measure, sense, and use attendance as a factor in grading? Should it be factored at all? Cameras or no cameras? How should teacherâ€™s time and energy be distributed to each student, considering some students put in different levels of effort? The members of this panel were <a href="https://portal.cca.edu/people/chamamoto/">Chris Hamamoto</a>, <a href="https://elizabethleeper.work/">Elizabeth Leeper</a>, and <a href="https://portal.cca.edu/people/marybanas/">Mary Banas</a>.</p>
