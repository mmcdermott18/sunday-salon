    <p>Hello out there!</p>

    <p>New year, new round of Sunday Salons! Weâ€™ve started cooking up some topic ideas for the first few months of the year, so you can look forward to a book release party, a discussion on the tenure process, and new teaching perspectives as we anticipate the (fingers crossed) gradual return to in-person instruction.</p>

    <p>To kick things off, we thought we would give some space to any ideas and reflections that percolated over winter break. So, as Spring semester gets underway, weâ€™re excited to invite you to another â€œWorks in Progressâ€ style Salon on Sunday, Feb 28th 4:30â€“6:00 PM EST.</p>

    <p>As before, weâ€™re looking for volunteers to share a work-in-progress, something that might benefit from a constructive and supportive conversation. Weâ€™re open to any and all formatsâ€”websites, book projects, creative research, proposals, visual experiments, etc.</p>

    <p>So, two requests:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, if you have a project youâ€™d like to share as a presenter, please let us know at your soonest convenience (before Friday 2/19 would be great!)</li>
      <li>Second, if you are available to participate in what we hope will be a fun afternoon of informal presentations and conversations, please let us know.</li>
    </ul>
