#### Jonathan Hanahan
Jonathan Hanahan is a creative technologist and educator who loves the internet but is equally terrified by it.

He uses technology to critique technology. His speculative practice explores the physical, cultural, and social ramifications of digital experiences and the role technology plays in shaping our everyday realities. He makes Thick Interfaces. These are tools, devices, software, artifacts, websites, and videos that agitate the digital facade and reveal the complexity existing underneath the thin veneer of our devices.

Hanahan earned his BArch from Virginia Tech and his MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design. In addition to his studio practice, Hanahan is an assistant professor in the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis, where he teaches creative coding, procedural process, and interaction design. He is also the co-founder and co-chair of [Fox Fridays](https://samfoxfridays.com/), an interdisciplinary workshop series encouraging experimentation with tools, processes, and technology.
