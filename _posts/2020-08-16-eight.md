### About
As the fall rapidly approaches, this salon will center around the theme of bias and grading. This will be a similar format to [Sunday Salon #6](/salon/number-6/) with large and small group participation and will hopefully generate some interesting and helpful ways to make the virtual experience better for you and your students.

We’ll be centering our discussion around the following topics:
* Topic 1 – Virtual Critique Methods
* Topic 2 – Virtual Community Building
* Topic 3 – Innovative Use of Zoom (or any other digital tool)

The structure of the Salon will be a combination of informal panel discussions and small group reflections.
