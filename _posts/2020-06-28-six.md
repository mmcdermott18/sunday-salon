### About
We are planning an active and participatory discussion around Bias and Grading, and we hope you’ll be able to take part.

We’ll be centering our discussion around the following questions:
* What role does grading play in your teaching practice?
* What strategies do you use to reduce bias in grading?
* How might bias play a role in the ways we evaluate participation?

The structure of the Salon will be a combination of informal panel discussions, and small group reflections.

#### What role does grading play in your teaching practice?
The panel discussed questions like: Are you an ‘easy grader’ or ‘hard grader’ and does it matter? Should grades be used to motivate students? Or are grades for comparing students to the class as a whole? What role, beyond completing assignments, might students play in assessment? The members of this panel were [Ben Shaykin](https://benjaminshaykin.com/), [Chris Lee](https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=V1c2NjJOZnlNdjBTd3dZRXNIa0t1UT09), and [Ana Llorente](https://portal.cca.edu/people/allorente/).

#### What strategies do you use to reduce bias in grading?
The panel discussed questions like: Do you work with a rubric? Do students self-assess? Effective grading systems for reducing teacher bias? Are there outside faculty / external critics that review student work? The members of this panel were [Elaine Lopez](https://www.mica.edu/undergraduate-majors-minors/graphic-design-major/elaine-lopez/), [Minkyoung Kim](https://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/minkyoung-kim), and [Rebecca Leffell Koren](https://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/portfolios/becca_leffell_koren).

#### How might bias play a role in the ways we evaluate participation?
The panel discussed questions like: During remote learning, how to measure, sense, and use attendance as a factor in grading? Should it be factored at all? Cameras or no cameras? How should teacher’s time and energy be distributed to each student, considering some students put in different levels of effort? The members of this panel were [Chris Hamamoto](https://portal.cca.edu/people/chamamoto/), [Elizabeth Leeper](https://elizabethleeper.work/), and [Mary Banas](https://portal.cca.edu/people/marybanas/).
