### About
Hello out there!

New year, new round of Sunday Salons! We’ve started cooking up some topic ideas for the first few months of the year, so you can look forward to a book release party, a discussion on the tenure process, and new teaching perspectives as we anticipate the (fingers crossed) gradual return to in-person instruction.

To kick things off, we thought we would give some space to any ideas and reflections that percolated over winter break. So, as Spring semester gets underway, we’re excited to invite you to another “Works in Progress” style Salon on Sunday, Feb 28th 4:30–6:00 PM EST.

As before, we’re looking for volunteers to share a work-in-progress, something that might benefit from a constructive and supportive conversation. We’re open to any and all formats—websites, book projects, creative research, proposals, visual experiments, etc.

So, two requests:
* First, if you have a project you’d like to share as a presenter, please let us know at your soonest convenience (before Friday 2/19 would be great!)
* Second, if you are available to participate in what we hope will be a fun afternoon of informal presentations and conversations, please let us know.
