### About
We’re excited to celebrate the release of **Black, Brown, + Latinx Design Educators**, a new book edited by our dear friend and Sunday Salon co-convener Kelly Walters. Kelly will walk us through the the process of developing this book—from concept to publication. This book highlights the experiences and perspectives of 12 design educators—from a range of ethnic and multiracial backgrounds—sharing wide-ranging stories from childhood experiences, to the ways each has navigated design education, academia, and professional practice.

#### Black, Brown, + Latinx Design Educators
In **Black, Brown + Latinx Design Educators**, Kelly Walters collects twelve deeply personal interviews with graphic design educators of color who teach at colleges and universities across the United States and Canada. The book centers the unique narratives of Black, Brown, and Latinx design educators, from their childhood experiences to their navigation of undergraduate and graduate studies and their career paths in academia and practice. The interviewees represent a cross-section of ethnic and multiracial backgrounds—African American, Jamaican, Indian, Pakistani, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican, and Brazilian. Their impactful stories offer invaluable perspectives for students and emerging designers of color, creating an entry point to address the complexities of race in design and bring to light the challenges of teaching graphic design at different types of public and private institutions. Interwoven throughout the book are images that maintain cultural significance, from family heirlooms to design works that highlight aspects of their cultural identities. Readers will gain insight into the multitude of experiences of Black, Brown, and Latinx design educators who teach and work in the field today.
