### About
What does it mean to collaborate in an increasingly flat and digital age? feeeels magazine is an annual publication exploring the role of tactility today and is created and produced by four graphic designers. In this Sunday Salon, the members of the feeeels team will discuss the importance of finding opportunities to collaborate outside of their professional practices, and their working process for collaborating on the first issue, feeeels—fuzzy. They will touch on the impetus for starting a new magazine, the steps of bringing the publication to press, lessons they’ve learned along the way, plans for the future of feeeels, and, lastly, just why there are four e’s in their name.
